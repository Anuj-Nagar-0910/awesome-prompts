## 1. üßÆ Code Generation Prompts (Data Analytics)

Prompts designed to generate executable code for real-world data tasks ‚Äî from ingestion to visualization.

**Core Functionalities**:
- Read & parse data (Excel, logs, cloud storage)
- Data cleaning & transformation
- Compute key metrics (e.g. CLV, revenue)
- Sort, filter, group, and aggregate
- Generate visualizations

**Key Technologies**:
- **Python**: `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- **R & SQL**: `ggplot2`, PostgreSQL
- **PySpark**: Distributed data cleaning and anomaly detection
- **JavaScript (Node.js + D3.js)**: Real-time dashboards, IoT analytics

**Outputs**:
- Cleaned datasets (CSV, Excel, Parquet)
- Auto-generated analytics reports
- Visualizations: bar charts, histograms, line plots ([smart-dashboard-demos](https://github.com/Anuj-Nagar-0910/smart-dashboard-demos) created from the prompt)

## 2. ‚ú® Creative Writing Prompts

Designed to inspire unique speculative fiction with deep lore, emotional stakes, and imaginative mechanics.

### Themes & Concepts:
- **Chrono-Cartography**: Maps that chart layers of time
- **Whispering Library of Unmade Dreams**: Sentient archive of abandoned aspirations
- **City of Echoing Memories**: Collective memories as atmospheric entities
- **Gastronome's Curse & Flavor Thief**: Memory-taste link disrupted by a black market
- **Symbiotic Architecture**: Emotionally responsive, living buildings

**Focus Areas**:
- Deep world-building  
- Mechanism-driven storytelling  
- Exploratory conflicts & character arcs

## 3. üß† Information Extraction Prompts

Prompts engineered to extract nuanced data from unstructured text, often requiring semantic inference and multimodal synthesis.

### Advanced Use Cases:
- **Lost Futures from Obsolete Patents**: Extract aspirations, blockers, tech forecasts
- **Narrative Intent via Micro-Expressions**: Decode emotional subtext from interviews
- **Urban Flow Mapping**: Infer invisible systems in decaying environments
- **Classified Ad Mining**: Reveal socio-economic currents from community listings
- **Silent Protocols in Science**: Decode tacit lab practices from correspondence

### Extraction Engines:
- **Narrative Data Sculptor**: Stakeholders, emotion flow, decisions in stories  
- **Policy Decoder**: Key clauses, exceptions, triggers in legal docs  
- **Scientific Fact Miner**: Findings, methodology, limitations from research  
- **Threat Intelligence Extractor**: IoCs, TTPs, threat actors from cyber reports  
- **Customer Intent Signal Extractor**: Motivations, blockers, brand perceptions  

**Output Formats**:
- Structured JSON  
- Tables & CSVs  
- Geo-referenced or relational datasets  
- Narrative insight briefs

## 4. üìù Summarization Prompts

Purpose-built to generate accurate and audience-tailored summaries from any textual source.

### Summary Types:
- **Extractive**: Factual bullet points, no opinions
- **Executive**: Sharp 3‚Äì4 sentence briefs
- **Narrative Summary**: Key arcs and decisions in story format
- **Book/Long-Read Digest**: Highlights & takeaways for busy readers

**Focus**:
- Accuracy over flair  
- Format flexibility (bullets, prose, headlines)  
- Tuned to stakeholder needs (analysts, execs, readers)

## üîß Use Cases At-a-Glance

| Prompt Type      | Applications                                | Output Format       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Code Generation  | Dashboards, ETL scripts, anomaly detection  | Python/R/JS scripts |
| Creative Writing | Story design, lore building, narrative arcs | Narratives, world guides |
| Info Extraction  | Legal, scientific, behavioral, threat intel | JSON, CSV, tables   |
| Summarization    | Meetings, articles, books, interviews       | Bullet lists, briefs|

---

**Tip**: These prompts are modular and extensible ‚Äî you can mix narrative design with structured extraction or use summarization post-IE for compact reports.
